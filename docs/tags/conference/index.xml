      <description>Relationship Between Intraclass Correlation and Percent Rater Agreement Authors: Jason Bryer; Guher Gorgun
Abstract Inter-rater reliability (IRR) is a critical component of establishing the reliability of measures when more than one rater is necessary. There are numerous IRR statistics available to researchers including percent rater agreement, Cohen&amp;rsquo;s Kappa, and several types of intraclass correlations (ICC). Several methodologists suggest using ICC over percent rater agreement (Hallgren, 2012; Koo &amp;amp; Li, 2016; McGraw &amp;amp; Wong, 1996; Shrout &amp;amp; Fleiss, 1979).</description>

      <description>Improving Interventions: Development of the Implementer Perception of Intervention Survey Authors: Jacqueline Slemp, Devora Panish, Erica Pawlo, Timothy Cleary
Abstract The Implementer Perception of Intervention Survey (IPIS) was developed to evaluate academic support personnel’s perceptions of the usability, feasibility, and importance of an academic intervention for developmental, entry-level college students. Principal axis factoring of the IPIS yielded a two-factor structure. The factors were labeled perceived acceptability and perceived usability. Practitioners can adapt the IPIS for use in a variety of academic interventions and educational contexts.</description>
