description: "In the past, newly enrolled college students had little reliable information about their readiness for college-level academic work. DAACS addresses this problem by providing students with detailed information and feedback on their preparation for college, as well as resources for shoring it up. By using DAACS, students can build needed skills in areas of self-regulated learning, writing, reading, and mathematics while enrolled in courses that lead to the completion of their degrees."
