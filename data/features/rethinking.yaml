description: "Traditional placement exams are high stakes assessments on which students receive either a passing or failing grade. Those who fail are placed into costly remediation courses that delay progress. In contrast, DAACS provides students with detailed information and feedback on their preparation for college-level work, as well as resources for shoring it up. Students can build needed skills while enrolled in courses that lead to the completion of their degrees."
