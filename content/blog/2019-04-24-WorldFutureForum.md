# Future Review Panel: Approaches to Studying Student Success in Higher Education

**Thursday, April 24, 11:25am to 12:10pm, Chicago**

This panel will highlight the work that is published in Future Review, our publication. Two of the first authors to publish in this journal will discuss their work on student success. The panel features both quantitative and qualitative research, and highlights the different ways of conceptualizing student success in higher education. Panelists will also discuss how their research can be used by practitioners in higher education, and why they chose Future Review as a venue for their research.
