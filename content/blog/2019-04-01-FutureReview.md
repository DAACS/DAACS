## Abstract

The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) online system assesses newly enrolled college students’ skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and self-regulated learning, and provides individualized feedback and links to resources. The purpose of this study is to examine validity evidence regarding the internal structure of the DAACS Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) self-report survey. Factor structure was initially examined using maximum-likelihood exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation on a pilot sample (n = 682). Based on the results, as well as the intended uses of the survey and expert opinion, two confirmatory factor analysis models were tested: the measurement model, and the instructional model. Validity evidence regarding the survey’s internal structure were gathered using a new sample of 6,644 adult learners at an online university. The confirmatory factor analysis results, correlations, and internal consistency reliability estimates suggested acceptable model fit for both the measurement and instructional models. Both models were retained to serve different purposes
